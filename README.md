# python-dsa-practice

This repository contains my ongoing practice with Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.
It follows the NeetCode roadmap and focuses on the most common patterns used in technical interviews.

Each problem includes:
- A short explanation of the approach
- The main idea or pattern used
- Time and space complexity
- A clean Python implementation

## Categories included so far
- Arrays & Hashing  
- Two Pointers  
- Sliding Window  
- Binary Search  

More categories will be added as I continue working through the roadmap.
